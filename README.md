# Telecom-Customer-churn-Prediction

🚀 Just Completed My Project on Customer Churn Prediction! 📊

In today's data-driven world, retaining customers is just as important as acquiring them. That’s why I built a Customer Churn Prediction model that can help businesses proactively identify customers who are likely to leave.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:

✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the data for optimal model performance.

✅ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Gained insights into key factors influencing customer churn.

✅ Feature Selection & Engineering: Identified impactful variables like contract type, internet service, and customer tenure.

✅ Model Building: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

✅ Model Evaluation: Compared models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 🎯

🏆 Best Performing Model: The Random Forest Classifier outperformed others, achieving high accuracy and reliability in predicting churn.

💡 Business Impact: With this model, businesses can focus their retention strategies more effectively, reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.

🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn
